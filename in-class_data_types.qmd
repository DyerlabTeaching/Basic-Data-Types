## Overview & Objective

This is the first foray into how to actually use `R` and focuses on understanding some of the most basic data types.

## Student Learning Objectives

At the end of this topic, you should be able to:  

 - Describe characteristics of numeric, character, logical, and date data types.  
 - Use introspection and coercion for basic data types. 
 - Perform operations on included data types.  


## Activity

The following markdown has a set of questions followed by a chunk for you to put in code to answer the question.  Fill them all out as indicated.


### Numeric Data

What is your favorite number

```{r}

```


The ancient Egyptians were quite cleaver at engineering and building things.  The [Rhind Papyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhind_Mathematical_Papyrus), which dates to 1650 BCE, indicates that they estimated the ratio between the circumference and the diameter of a circle to be 256 divided by 81.  Create a variable that estimates the papyrus version of pi.  Compare it to the value of the real version of pi (in `R`, we use `pi` a built-in variable.) Mathematically is the previous version greater or less than what we use now? 

```{r}

```



The function `sqrt()` provides you the square root of a number. Assign a variable named `root2` to hold the value of `sqrt(2)`.  Show the value of this variable.

```{r}

```


What is the value contained in the variable below named `sqrOfNegative2`?  Is this what you would expect for the square of -2? Why or why not?

```{r}
sqrOfNegative2 <- -2^2
```



### Character Data

Create variables for your first and last names (and give them proper variable names).

```{r}

```


Combine these variables into a single variable `fullName` using `paste()`.

```{r}

```


Use the functions `print()` and `cat()` to display `fullName`.  Do these two functions produce identical output?  Explain.

```{r}

```


Create a new variable, `properName`, which is your last name, a comma and space, followed by your first name (see the help for `paste()` and in particular the `sep` argument.)  Use the variables above instead of writing out the letters for your names.

```{r}

```


The function `nchar()` returns the number of characters in a character variable.  Use it on your `properName`.  How many characters are in your name?

```{r}

```


### Logical Data 

Create the variables `trueResult` and `falseResult` and assign them the approprite values.

```{r}

```


Using the variables `trueResult` and `falseResult` to demonstrate logical operators for *equality*, *inequality*, and *negation*.

```{r}

```


Using the variables `trueResult` and `falseResult` demonstrate AND operator in R for all pairwise combinations (e.g, for the and operator, show how to evaluate `trueResult` and `trueResult`, `trueResult` and `falseResult`, `falseResult` and `trueResult`, and `falseResult` and `falseResult`)

```{r}

```

Do the same as the previous question for the appropriate OR operator.

```{r}

```


In the example above for the square root, the variable `root2` has the square root of the number $2$.  Create a variable called `two` that multiples `root2 * root2`.  

```{r}

```


Does the new variable, `two` equal `2` (test using equality operator do not look at it).

```{r}

```



### Dates


When did you first become a college student?  Create a variable representing this date.

```{r}

```


How many days was it between then and now?

```{r}

```
